# ✅ Android App Production Release Checklist

A comprehensive checklist for publishing your Android (or Flutter) app to the Play Store safely, securely, and professionally.

---

### 📊 Analytics & Crash Reporting
- [ ] Integrate analytics tools (Firebase Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude).
- [ ] Integrate crash reporting (Firebase Crashlytics, Sentry).
- [ ] Validate that no debug events or test data pollutes production reports.

---

### 🧪 Build & Configuration
- [ ] Disable logging and debugging flags (`BuildConfig.DEBUG`).
- [ ] Replace all dev/staging API URLs and keys with production values.
- [ ] Apply Proguard/R8 for code shrinking, obfuscation, and optimization.
- [ ] Obfuscate strings and sensitive logic.
- [ ] Use Secure Storage or Firebase Remote Config to protect API keys.
- [ ] Ensure no secrets or keys are hardcoded in the APK.

---

### 🧩 Feature Management
- [ ] Use feature flags for controlled rollouts (e.g., Firebase Remote Config).
- [ ] Add kill switches for experimental or risky features.

---

### 📦 App Size & Resource Management
- [ ] Check APK/AAB size and compare with previous versions.
- [ ] Remove unused assets (images, layouts, drawables).
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies and dead code.

---

### 📲 UI/UX Conformance
- [ ] Use adaptive icons across all Android versions.
- [ ] Implement new splash screen API (Android 12+).
- [ ] Ensure proper localization (strings.xml in multiple languages).
- [ ] Add/update `WHAT'S NEW` in the Play Store listing.
- [ ] Include updated screenshots and feature graphics.

---

### 🔐 Security & Compliance
- [ ] Add `android:exported="true/false"` in all components (Android 12+).
- [ ] Check for unintentional permission additions in `AndroidManifest.xml`.
- [ ] Validate app against tampering using Play Integrity API or SafetyNet.
- [ ] Review Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.
- [ ] Ensure compliance with GDPR, COPPA, and other local laws.
- [ ] Secure user data and offer proper backup/export options.

---

### 📤 Navigation & Linking
- [ ] Test all deep links and App Links (especially `intent-filters`).
- [ ] Validate navigation flow with nav2.0/go_router if Flutter.

---

### 🕰️ Background Tasks
- [ ] Test `WorkManager`, `JobScheduler`, or `AlarmManager` jobs.
- [ ] Validate performance and battery impact (`adb shell dumpsys batterystats`).

---

### 🧪 Testing
- [ ] Add and run all unit tests.
- [ ] Test upgrade path from previous APKs (delta update testing).
- [ ] Test on various Android versions and screen sizes.
- [ ] Test offline/no-network behavior (airplane mode).

---

### 🌟 Play Store Prep
- [ ] Enable staged rollout if it’s a major release.
- [ ] Add Google’s in-app review prompt.
- [ ] Respond to or resolve past Play Store feedback.
- [ ] Confirm correct `versionCode` and `versionName`.
- [ ] Use internal testing track → closed beta → production.

---

### ✅ Final Validation
- [ ] Run lint checks and resolve warnings/errors.
- [ ] Manually test all critical flows (auth, payment, deep links).
- [ ] Validate crash-free session stability for the internal test.
- [ ] Submit to Play Store with changelog, new graphics, and proper versioning.

---

## 🧠 Bonus Tips
- Automate this checklist with CI/CD tools like Bitrise, GitHub Actions.
- Store secrets in CI vaults (not in repo).
- Monitor app vitals post-release.
